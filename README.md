Daybreak is a fullstack web application inspired by the asymmetrical 4-versus-1 horror game, Dead by Daylight. The app serves as a tracker where users can record their loadouts, or personal builds, to journal their gameplay experience. A core part of Dead by Daylight is the usage of Perks, which are minor abilities, buffs, or advantages users select to add to their character to gain an edge in matches. In a game with over 131 perks for Survivors alone and always more in development for future release, the various combinations and interactions can prove difficult to track without some sort of external record-keeping system. The UI aesthetic reflects the environment and tone for players familiar to the game.
